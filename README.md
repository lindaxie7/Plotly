# Plotly
## Overview of Project
For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, what is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies?
Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. In this project, we will use plotly to identify the top 10 bacterial species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. 

## Results
Here are the "charts" I created: https://lindaxie7.github.io/Plotly/



## Summary
-The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage, it displays the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

-The bubble chart that displays the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage: The otu_ids as the x-axis values. The sample_values as the y-axis values. The sample_values as the marker size. The otu_ids as the marker colors. The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

-The gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
