# Plotly
## Overview of Project
For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, what is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies?
Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. In this project, we will use plotly to identify the top 10 bacterial species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.
